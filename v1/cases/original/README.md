There are two tops available in this directory:

1. `top.(step|stl)`: the standard top, designed for wired builds. The USB cutout height is appropriate for a [xiao rp2040](https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-RP2040-v1-0-p-5026.html) controller socketed with [peel-a-way sockets](https://keeb.io/products/peel-a-way-sockets-for-pro-micros).
2. `top-ble.(step|stl)`: is an alternate top, designed for wireless builds. The center portion has been raised to give more room for a battery, and a cutout has been added between the thumb keys to give access to the power switch. The USB cutout height is appropriate for a [xiao nrf52840](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-BLE-nRF52840-p-5201.html) controller socketed with peel-a-way sockets, with additional [male header pins](https://www.amazon.com/Straight-Breakaway-Connector-Breadboard-Electronic/dp/B09MYHFY3D). Depending on your exact socketing hardware, you may need to adjust the USB cutout height.

Both tops are compatible with the common `bottom.(step|stl)` files.
